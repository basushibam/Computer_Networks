The field fd contains a file descriptor for an open file.  If this
       field is negative, then the corresponding events field is ignored and
       the revents field returns zero.  (This provides an easy way of ignor‚Äê
       ing a file descriptor for a single poll() call: simply negate the fd
       field.  Note, however, that this technique can't be used to ignore
       file descriptor 0.)

       The field events is an input parameter, a bit mask specifying the
       events the application is interested in for the file descriptor fd.
       This field may be specified as zero, in which case the only events
       that can be returned in revents are POLLHUP, POLLERR, and POLLNVAL
       (see below).

       The field revents is an output parameter, filled by the kernel with
       the events that actually occurred.  The bits returned in revents can
       include any of those specified in events, or one of the values
       POLLERR, POLLHUP, or POLLNVAL.  (These three bits are meaningless in
       the events field, and will be set in the revents field whenever the
       corresponding condition is true.)

       If none of the events requested (and no error) has occurred for any
       of the file descriptors, then poll() blocks until one of the events
       occurs.
